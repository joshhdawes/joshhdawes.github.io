### Dr Joshua H Dawes

**Research Associate at SnT, Luxembourg**

I spend most of my time leading the research activities at SnT on Runtime Verification and Specification-based Security Analysis, as part of the COSMOS Horizon 2020 project.

### My PhD

I was awarded my PhD in 2021 by the University of Manchester in the UK.  I spent the entirety of my PhD at the CMS Experiment at CERN in Geneva.

My focus was on Runtime Verification for the performance analysis of web services.  I introduced the CFTL specification language, and led a small team to develop an ecosystem of tools that is released as the [VyPR Project](http://pyvypr.github.io/home/).

You can find my thesis on CERN's [document repository](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2766727?ln=en).

### Additional Talks

At various times I've given talks about various aspects of my work, separately from publications.  Here's a list:
* **VyPR2: A Framework for Runtime Verification of Python Web Services.** *CERN Computing Seminar, Geneva, Switzerland, 2019*

### Students

One of the best parts of my job is student supervision.  Here's a list of the students I've supervised over the years, on projects related to my research:
* *Per Sunde* (University of Oslo), CERN Summer Student 2018, **Timed Pushdown Automata for Offline Runtime Verification**
* *Marta Han* (University of Zagreb), CERN Summer Student 2019 and CERN Technical Student 2020, **Development of Analysis Tools for VyPR**
* *Jurgis Rancevas* (University of Vilnius), Erasmus Student 2019, **Automated Release Validation of the CMS Experiment's Conditions Upload Service**
